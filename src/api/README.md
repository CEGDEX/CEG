# API Interface Module

## Introduction
The module implements a variety of interface service functions, as follows:
- HTTP service. There are two ways for this service: one is the API interface, through which you can interact with the node blockchain account, such as querying account information, querying transactions, submitting transactions, calling contracts, etc.; second, it provides access to HTTP pages.
- WebSocket interface service. It provides the ability to initiate transactions and subscribe to transactions.
- Console interface. It provides users with the console mode to operate Wallet, get CEG value, pay CEG and other operations.

## Module Structure

Class name | Statement file | Function
|:--- | --- | ---
| `WebServer` | [web_server.h](./web_server.h) | Provider of HTTP service. Use `http::server::server` to provide HTTP service (refer to [server.hpp](../3rd/http/server.hpp)). It implements routing in the `WebServer` class to invoke the HTTP interface and access HTTP pages.
| `WebSocketServer` | [websocket_server.h](./websocket_server.h) | Provider of Web Socket service. This class extends from `Network` class (refer to [network.h](../common/network.h)).`Network` uses `asio::io_service` asynchronous IO to listen for network events and manage all network connections. The function of `WebSocketServer` is as follows: the originating transaction and the transaction subscription service are provided to the external node; broadcast transaction interfaces are provided for other internal modules for notifying the subscriber of the related transactions.
| `Console` | [console.h](./console.h) | Provider of the console command service. It has a separate thread execution environment, listens to input operations after startup, and performs operations according to instructions. During the execution it will call other modules such as `KeyStore` (refer to [key_store.h](../common/key_store.h))ï¼Œor `GlueManager` (refer to [glue_manager.h](../glue/glue_manager.h)) etc.
